<h1>Questions#answer</h1>
<p>Find me in app/views/questions/answer.html.erb</p>

<!-- The answer.html.erb will display the question you ask your coach as well as his answer. The controller will need to read the question from params and compute an instance variable @answer for the view to display. -->





<% if params["question"] == "I am going to work" %>

<%  params["question"].include?("?") %>
<%=  "Silly question, get dressed and go to work!"%>
<% else %>
<%=  "I don't care, get dressed and go to work!"%>
